Interactive 401(k) contribution calculator with real-time retirement projections and compound interest modeling.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts

**Why?** Familiarity and speed. I've developed apps with this stack—no learning curve, just building. Vite gives instant dev server startup. Tailwind lets me ship UI without switching contexts. Recharts handles the graph complexity.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:5173
